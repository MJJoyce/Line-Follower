A Line Following Robot

The arduino sketch is located in <sketch file info here>.

For a schematic of the wiring, see <schematic file>.

This robot will try to follow a black line drawn on a light colored background. The black line should be fairly thick (Think black electrical tape, not a pen) to work properly.
